## This repository has the ui.R and server.R files as part of the Developing Data Products Course Project.  
## In part first we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
## As part two of the project we should use Slidify/Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.
